Experiment set up

# Goal Evaluating distance metrics to evaluate paraphrase detection
Test against traiin set for paraphrases

Test harness
	Baseline: cosine similarity w/ threshold of .85
	Infersent:
		variables: vocab size (top 1000, 10000, 50000)
				   corpus vocab
				   lemmatize input
		- cosine sim w/ threshold of .85
		- euclidean dist?

Evaluation
	- F1 and accuracy

Experiments:
Preprocessing 
	- L1 norm 
	- L2 norm
